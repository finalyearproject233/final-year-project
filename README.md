# STRATERA Desktop Applications

Professional desktop software suite by **STRATERA R&D Software Group**.

This monorepo contains two Electron-based desktop applications with a **shared SQLite database**, user authentication, and consistent STRATERA branding.

| Application | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **STRATERA Accounting** | Financial management — accounts, transactions, invoices, and reports |
| **STRATERA HR** | Human resources — employees, payroll, attendance, leave, and departments |

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or later
- npm 9+

## Setup

```bash
cd STRATERA
npm install
```

**Windows PowerShell:** If `npm` fails with a script execution policy error, use `npm.cmd` instead of `npm`, or double-click `install.bat` in the project folder.

**Electron failed to install:** Double-click `fix-electron.bat`, then run `start-accounting.bat` again.

## Run in Development

**Accounting app:**
```bash
npm run accounting
```

Or double-click `start-accounting.bat`.

**HR app:**
```bash
npm run hr
```

Or double-click `start-hr.bat`.

## Demo Login Credentials

| Email | Password | Access |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `admin@stratera.com` | `admin123` | Both apps |
| `accountant@stratera.com` | `account123` | Accounting only |
| `hr@stratera.com` | `hr123` | HR only |

## Data Persistence

Both applications share a single SQLite database stored locally at:

`%APPDATA%/STRATERA/stratera.db`

Data is seeded automatically on first launch with sample records.

## Build Installers

```bash
npm run build:accounting
npm run build:hr
```

Windows installers are output to `accounting/release/` and `hr/release/`.
